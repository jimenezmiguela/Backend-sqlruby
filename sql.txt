SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT OrderID, ProductName, Quantity FROM OrderDetails od INNER JOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID;


Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT (e.FirstName || " " || e.LastName) AS EmployeeName, ProductID, Quantity FROM Orders o INNER JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID INNER JOIN Employees e ON e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID;
